# House Price Prediction Project

This project predicts house prices using machine learning techniques, leveraging libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data analysis and model building.

## Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model training and evaluation.

## Project Overview
- **Goal**: Predict house prices based on features such as location, size, and other attributes.
- **Dataset**: Contains house features and corresponding prices.

## Features
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Managed missing values.
   - Encoded categorical variables for compatibility with machine learning models.
2. **Model Building**:
   - Used Scikit-learn's regression algorithms.
   - Evaluated performance using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
3. **Insights**:
   - Analyzed key factors influencing house prices using exploratory data analysis.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Omkar891/house-price-prediction.git
